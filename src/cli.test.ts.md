    `# Token␊
    ␊
    ## own␊
    ␊
    own function␊
    ␊
    ## constructor␊
    ␊
    Sets the values for {name} and {symbol}, initializes {decimals} with␊
    a default value of 18.␊
    To select a different value for {decimals}, use {_setupDecimals}.␊
    All three of these values are immutable: they can only be set once during␊
    construction.␊
    ␊
    ## name␊
    ␊
    Returns the name of the token.␊
    ␊
    ## symbol␊
    ␊
    Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the␊
    name.␊
    ␊
    ## decimals␊
    ␊
    Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.␊
    For example, if `decimals` equals `2`, a balance of `505` tokens should␊
    be displayed to a user as `5,05` (`505 / 10 ** 2`).␊
    Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between␊
    Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses, unless {_setupDecimals} is␊
    called.␊
    NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in␊
    no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including␊
    {IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}.␊
    ␊
    ## totalSupply␊
    ␊
    See {IERC20-totalSupply}.␊
    ␊
    ## balanceOf␊
    ␊
    See {IERC20-balanceOf}.␊
    ␊
    ## transfer␊
    ␊
    See {IERC20-transfer}.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - `recipient` cannot be the zero address.␊
    - the caller must have a balance of at least `amount`.␊
    ␊
    ## allowance␊
    ␊
    See {IERC20-allowance}.␊
    ␊
    ## approve␊
    ␊
    See {IERC20-approve}.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - `spender` cannot be the zero address.␊
    ␊
    ## transferFrom␊
    ␊
    See {IERC20-transferFrom}.␊
    Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance. This is not␊
    required by the EIP. See the note at the beginning of {ERC20}.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - `sender` and `recipient` cannot be the zero address.␊
    - `sender` must have a balance of at least `amount`.␊
    - the caller must have allowance for ``sender``'s tokens of at least␊
    `amount`.␊
    ␊
    ## increaseAllowance␊
    ␊
    Atomically increases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller.␊
    This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for␊
    problems described in {IERC20-approve}.␊
    Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - `spender` cannot be the zero address.␊
    ␊
    ## decreaseAllowance␊
    ␊
    Atomically decreases the allowance granted to `spender` by the caller.␊
    This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for␊
    problems described in {IERC20-approve}.␊
    Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - `spender` cannot be the zero address.␊
    - `spender` must have allowance for the caller of at least␊
    `subtractedValue`.␊
    ␊
    ## _transfer␊
    ␊
    Moves tokens `amount` from `sender` to `recipient`.␊
    This is internal function is equivalent to {transfer}, and can be used to␊
    e.g. implement automatic token fees, slashing mechanisms, etc.␊
    Emits a {Transfer} event.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - `sender` cannot be the zero address.␊
    - `recipient` cannot be the zero address.␊
    - `sender` must have a balance of at least `amount`.␊
    ␊
    ## _mint␊
    ␊
    Creates `amount` tokens and assigns them to `account`, increasing␊
    the total supply.␊
    Emits a {Transfer} event with `from` set to the zero address.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - `to` cannot be the zero address.␊
    ␊
    ## _burn␊
    ␊
    Destroys `amount` tokens from `account`, reducing the␊
    total supply.␊
    Emits a {Transfer} event with `to` set to the zero address.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - `account` cannot be the zero address.␊
    - `account` must have at least `amount` tokens.␊
    ␊
    ## _approve␊
    ␊
    Sets `amount` as the allowance of `spender` over the `owner` s tokens.␊
    This internal function is equivalent to `approve`, and can be used to␊
    e.g. set automatic allowances for certain subsystems, etc.␊
    Emits an {Approval} event.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - `owner` cannot be the zero address.␊
    - `spender` cannot be the zero address.␊
    ␊
    ## _setupDecimals␊
    ␊
    Sets {decimals} to a value other than the default one of 18.␊
    WARNING: This function should only be called from the constructor. Most␊
    applications that interact with token contracts will not expect␊
    {decimals} to ever change, and may work incorrectly if it does.␊
    ␊
    ## _beforeTokenTransfer␊
    ␊
    Hook that is called before any transfer of tokens. This includes␊
    minting and burning.␊
    Calling conditions:␊
    - when `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens␊
    will be to transferred to `to`.␊
    - when `from` is zero, `amount` tokens will be minted for `to`.␊
    - when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens will be burned.␊
    - `from` and `to` are never both zero.␊
