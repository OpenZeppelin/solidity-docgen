OpenZeppelin is a library for writing secure [Smart Contracts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smart_contract) on Ethereum.

With OpenZeppelin, you can build distributed applications, protocols and organizations:
- using common contract security patterns (See [Onward with Ethereum Smart Contract Security](https://medium.com/bitcorps-blog/onward-with-ethereum-smart-contract-security-97a827e47702#.y3kvdetbz)).
- in the [Solidity language](https://solidity.readthedocs.io/en/develop/).

> NOTE: New to smart contract development? Check our [introductory guide](https://medium.com/zeppelin-blog/the-hitchhikers-guide-to-smart-contracts-in-ethereum-848f08001f05#.cox40d2ut).


## Security
OpenZeppelin is meant to provide secure, tested and community-audited code, but please use common sense when doing anything that deals with real money! We take no responsibility for your implementation decisions and any security problem you might experience.

If you find a security issue, please email [security@openzeppelin.org](mailto:security@openzeppelin.org).
