    `# Token␊
    ␊
    ## own␊
    ␊
    own function␊
    ␊
    ## constructor␊
    ␊
    Sets the values for {name} and {symbol}.␊
    The defaut value of {decimals} is 18. To select a different value for␊
    {decimals} you should overload it.␊
    All three of these values are immutable: they can only be set once during␊
    construction.␊
    ␊
    ## name␊
    ␊
    Returns the name of the token.␊
    ␊
    ## symbol␊
    ␊
    Returns the symbol of the token, usually a shorter version of the␊
    name.␊
    ␊
    ## decimals␊
    ␊
    Returns the number of decimals used to get its user representation.␊
    For example, if \`decimals\` equals \`2\`, a balance of \`505\` tokens should␊
    be displayed to a user as \`5,05\` (\`505 / 10 ** 2\`).␊
    Tokens usually opt for a value of 18, imitating the relationship between␊
    Ether and Wei. This is the value {ERC20} uses, unless this function is␊
    overloaded;␊
    NOTE: This information is only used for _display_ purposes: it in␊
    no way affects any of the arithmetic of the contract, including␊
    {IERC20-balanceOf} and {IERC20-transfer}.␊
    ␊
    ## totalSupply␊
    ␊
    See {IERC20-totalSupply}.␊
    ␊
    ## balanceOf␊
    ␊
    See {IERC20-balanceOf}.␊
    ␊
    ## transfer␊
    ␊
    See {IERC20-transfer}.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - \`recipient\` cannot be the zero address.␊
    - the caller must have a balance of at least \`amount\`.␊
    ␊
    ## allowance␊
    ␊
    See {IERC20-allowance}.␊
    ␊
    ## approve␊
    ␊
    See {IERC20-approve}.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - \`spender\` cannot be the zero address.␊
    ␊
    ## transferFrom␊
    ␊
    See {IERC20-transferFrom}.␊
    Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance. This is not␊
    required by the EIP. See the note at the beginning of {ERC20}.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - \`sender\` and \`recipient\` cannot be the zero address.␊
    - \`sender\` must have a balance of at least \`amount\`.␊
    - the caller must have allowance for \`\`sender\`\`'s tokens of at least␊
    \`amount\`.␊
    ␊
    ## increaseAllowance␊
    ␊
    Atomically increases the allowance granted to \`spender\` by the caller.␊
    This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for␊
    problems described in {IERC20-approve}.␊
    Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - \`spender\` cannot be the zero address.␊
    ␊
    ## decreaseAllowance␊
    ␊
    Atomically decreases the allowance granted to \`spender\` by the caller.␊
    This is an alternative to {approve} that can be used as a mitigation for␊
    problems described in {IERC20-approve}.␊
    Emits an {Approval} event indicating the updated allowance.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - \`spender\` cannot be the zero address.␊
    - \`spender\` must have allowance for the caller of at least␊
    \`subtractedValue\`.␊
    ␊
    ## _transfer␊
    ␊
    Moves tokens \`amount\` from \`sender\` to \`recipient\`.␊
    This is internal function is equivalent to {transfer}, and can be used to␊
    e.g. implement automatic token fees, slashing mechanisms, etc.␊
    Emits a {Transfer} event.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - \`sender\` cannot be the zero address.␊
    - \`recipient\` cannot be the zero address.␊
    - \`sender\` must have a balance of at least \`amount\`.␊
    ␊
    ## _mint␊
    ␊
    Creates \`amount\` tokens and assigns them to \`account\`, increasing␊
    the total supply.␊
    Emits a {Transfer} event with \`from\` set to the zero address.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - \`to\` cannot be the zero address.␊
    ␊
    ## _burn␊
    ␊
    Destroys \`amount\` tokens from \`account\`, reducing the␊
    total supply.␊
    Emits a {Transfer} event with \`to\` set to the zero address.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - \`account\` cannot be the zero address.␊
    - \`account\` must have at least \`amount\` tokens.␊
    ␊
    ## _approve␊
    ␊
    Sets \`amount\` as the allowance of \`spender\` over the \`owner\` s tokens.␊
    This internal function is equivalent to \`approve\`, and can be used to␊
    e.g. set automatic allowances for certain subsystems, etc.␊
    Emits an {Approval} event.␊
    Requirements:␊
    - \`owner\` cannot be the zero address.␊
    - \`spender\` cannot be the zero address.␊
    ␊
    ## _beforeTokenTransfer␊
    ␊
    Hook that is called before any transfer of tokens. This includes␊
    minting and burning.␊
    Calling conditions:␊
    - when \`from\` and \`to\` are both non-zero, \`amount\` of \`\`from\`\`'s tokens␊
    will be to transferred to \`to\`.␊
    - when \`from\` is zero, \`amount\` tokens will be minted for \`to\`.␊
    - when \`to\` is zero, \`amount\` of \`\`from\`\`'s tokens will be burned.␊
    - \`from\` and \`to\` are never both zero.␊
